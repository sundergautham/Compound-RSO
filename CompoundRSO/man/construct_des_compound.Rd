\item{rng}{seed for random number generation for the random design construction starts}

\item{num_cores}{number of cores for parallel processing. Default value is NA, in which case Sys.getenv("PBS_RESC_TOTAL_PROCS") is used to get the number of cores in a HPC. Otherwise, the user needs to provide a value. Use 1 for serial execution.}

\description{
function for initiating multiple starts of an Adaptive-RSO designs using coordinate exchange.This is the parallel version and works only on linux machines. The Adaptive-RSO designs are compound optimal designs between Bayesian D-optimal designs and I-optimal designs and we use bisection search algorithm to determine the optimal weight w.
